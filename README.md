# LinkedIn Searcher
## This tool allows an automated search of jobs on LinkedIn.
Please be responsible with it, APIs are not free to use an unlimited amount.

## To use
1. Clone the repository
2. Make code changes to match your desired search and filter criteria in the `main()` method of `LinkedInSearch.java`
3. Sign up for an API key at `https://rapidapi.com/rockapis-rockapis-default/api/linkedin-data-api`
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root (where the `pom.xml` file is)
5. Enter `API_KEY=`, then append your API key
6. Ensure that all dependencies have been downloaded by Maven
7. Run the `main()` method of `LinkedInSearch.java`
8. LinkedIn job URLs will be posted to the console

## Future development
This project is something I hastily threw together, I don't anticipate it to be ideal.
I will improve this project as needed, but due to the limits placed on the free tier of the API, I can only test changes about once a month.
